<h1>This is me testing an HTML heading</h1>
<p>And <strong>here</strong> is <mark>a paragraph of text that is at least a couple of lines <em>probably</em> once it has all been typed out.</mark>  I think I hit <q>line two or three</q> by now hopefully. <br/> Ok, that should do it. Yup</p>
<h2>a second level heading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ok let's try a list</li>
  <li>with a couple items in it</li>
</ul>
<h3>third level heading</h3>
<details>
  <summary>Collapsible thing</summary>
  this is the stuff that expands out but is otherwise hidden.
</details>
<hr/>
<h4>do 4th level headings look different?</h4>
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Heading 1</th>
    <th>Heading 2</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>data 1</td>
    <td>data 2</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>data 3</td>
    <td>data 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data 5</td>
    <td>data 6</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
