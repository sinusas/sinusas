<h1>This is me testing an HTML heading</h1>
<p>And here is a paragraph of text that is at least a couple of lines probably once it has all been typed out.  I think I hit line two or three by now hopefully. Ok, that should do it. Yup</p>
<h2>a second level heading</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ok let's try a list</li>
  <li>with a couple items in it</li>
</ul>
<h3>third level heading</h3>
<details>
  <summary>Collapsible thing</summary>
  this is the stuff that expands out but is otherwise hidden.
</details>
